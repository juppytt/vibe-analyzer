You are given a rough product brief. Produce a 5-bullet summary for a PM.

Brief:
- We want to benchmark how different agents respond to the same task prompt.
- Each run should replace a placeholder with the real input file name.
- Output should be JSON so we can aggregate later.
- Rotate agents when a rate limit is hit, otherwise stick to the current agent.
- Keep logs for auditing.
